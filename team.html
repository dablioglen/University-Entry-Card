        <div class="title">All About Justine</div>
        <p>Justine Jobert S. Padpad, also known as Sn. Someday I wanted to become a professional programmer so that I can achieve my goal and ambition. Everybody has an ambition in life. Aim or ambition is the inner aspiration of man. No man can do anything in the world without aim. So, all of us should be very determined about our aim in life.

          Without good career planning, right from the start, one canâ€™t be on the right track. One has to set the goals in accordance with his or her broad career goals. As every man have weaknesses, so have also. I am a little bit lazy at some places which I do not like. While playing time, I pass my lot of time there which is not a good habit, but I try my best to overcome my weaknesses.
